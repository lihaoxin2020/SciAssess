Gene mutations are important predictive biomarkers that influence MM treatment decision. The aim of our study was to uncover the clinical significance of mutated genes in MM in the Chinese population. \n Methods: Targeted exon panel sequencing was performed of 400 genes to detect the gene mutation status in plasma cells from 50 patients with MM. DAVID was used to explore the functions and pathways of mutated genes. Detection of mutant gene expression, prognosis and immune cell infiltration with GSE6477. GEO2R was utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kaplan-Meier and CIBERSORT were applied to compare survival distributions and evaluate the gene expression associated with immune cell infiltration, respectively. \n Results: Mutations of 337 genes were identified in MM. The mutation types included SNP, INS, and DEL, but the dominant mutation type was SNP. Function and pathway analysis of mutant genes were performed to elucidate DNA modifications. We identified a total number of 660 downregulated and 587 upregulated genes from the GSE6477 dataset. Thirty-three common genes were present in both the mutant genes and DEGs. The functions and pathways of the mutated genes were enriched in myeloid cell differentiation, regulation of hemopoiesis, etc. Moreover, we found that the low expression of BCL6, BIRC3, HLA-DQA1, and VCAN was correlated with poor prognosis in MM. \n Conclusions: The mutations and low expression of BCL6, BIRC3, HLA-DQA1, and VCAN were correlated with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration in MM.

Metabolomic profiling of prostate cancer (PCa) progression identified markedly elevated levels of sarcosine (N-methyl glycine) in metastatic PCa and modest but significant elevation of the metabolite in PCa urine. Here, we examine the role of key enzymes associated with sarcosine metabolism in PCa progression. Consistent with our earlier report, sarcosine levels were significantly elevated in PCa urine sediments compared to controls, with a modest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71. In addition, the expression of sarcosine biosynthetic enzyme, glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), was elevated in PCa tissues, while sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) and pipecolic acid oxidase (PIPOX), which metabolize sarcosine, were reduced in prostate tumors. Consistent with this, GNMT promoted the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by facilitating sarcosine production, while SARDH and PIPOX reduced the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by metabolizing sarcosine. Accordingly, addition of sarcosine, but not glycine or alanine, induced invasion and intravasation in an in vivo PCa model. In contrast, GNMT knockdown or SARDH overexpression in PCa xenografts inhibited tumor growth.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate predictive and prognostic significance of microtubule-associated protein Tau in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. METHODS: 74 patients with EOC (stage I-IV) who underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by standard paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy were included in the retrospective analysis. Their formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were immunohistochemically stained for Tau protein, using semi-quantitative DAKO test. Tau expression was acknowledged as negative (0 and 1+) or positive (2+ and 3+). The correlation between Tau expression, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meyer estimator, long rank test, Mann Whitney test and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: 25.7% (19/74) and 74.3% (55/74) of the patients were classified as Tau-negative and Tau-positive, respectively. Median PFS was 28.7 months for Tau-negative group and 15.9 months for Tau-positive group (p = 0.0355). In the univariate analysis 3-year OS in Tau-negative and Tau-positive groups was 80.2% and 52.4%, respectively (p = 0.0198). Low expression of protein Tau was associated with better OS, whereas an advanced stage at diagnosis, suboptimal surgery, serous histological type and resistance to first line chemotherapy were each correlated with worse OS (p <0,05). In multivariate analysis only resistance to first line chemotherapy remained significant (HR 22.59; 95% CI, 8.71-58.55; p <0.0001).

CD44, an adhesion molecule that binds to the extracellular matrix, primarily to hyaluronan (HA), has been implicated in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. CD44 has also recently been recognized as a marker for stem cells of several types of cancer. However, the roles of CD44 in the development of bone metastasis are unclear. Here, we addressed this issue by using bone metastatic cancer cell lines, in which CD44 was stably knocked down. Tumor sphere formation and cell migration and invasion were significantly inhibited by CD44 knockdown. Furthermore, the downregulation of CD44 markedly suppressed tumorigenicity and bone metastases in nude mice. Of note, the number of osteoclasts decreased in the bone metastases. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of HA synthase 2 was downregulated in CD44-knockdown cells. The localization of HA in the bone metastatic tumors was also markedly reduced. We then examined the roles of CD44-HA interaction in bone metastasis using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an inhibitor of HA synthesis. 4-MU decreased tumor sphere and osteoclast-like cell formation in vitro. Moreover, 4-MU inhibited bone metastases in vivo with reduced number of osteoclasts. These results collectively suggest that CD44 expression in cancer cells promotes bone metastases by enhancing tumorigenicity, cell migration and invasion, and HA production. Our results also suggest the possible involvement of CD44-expressing cancer stem cells in the development of bone metastases through interaction with HA. CD44-HA interaction could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for bone metastases.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(CD44,GOF,Bonemetastasis)"}

PURPOSE: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) accounts for the majority of epithelial ovarian cancer deaths. Genomic and functional data suggest that approximately half of unselected HGSC have disruption of the BRCA pathway and defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR). Pathway disruption is regarded as imparting a BRCAness phenotype. We explored the molecular changes in HGSC arising in association with specific BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic or germline mutations and in those with BRCA1 DNA promoter methylation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We describe gene expression and copy number analysis of two large cohorts of HGSC in which both germline and somatic inactivation of HRR has been measured. RESULTS: BRCA1 disruptions were associated with the C2 (immunoreactive) molecular subtype of HGSC, characterized by intense intratumoral T-cell infiltration. We derived and validated a predictor of BRCA1 mutation or methylation status, but could not distinguish BRCA2 from wild-type tumors. DNA copy number analysis showed that cases with BRCA1 mutation were significantly associated with amplification both at 8q24 (frequencies: BRCA1 tumors 50%, BRCA2 tumors 32%, and wild-type tumors 9%) and regions of the X-chromosome specifically dysregulated in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC; BRCA1 62%, BRCA2 34%, and wild-type 35%).

A detailed definition of the neuro-ophthalmologic spectrum of CADASIL might provide new insights in the pathophysiology of small-vessel diseases. Therefore, this study aims to precisely delineate the features and the prevalence of the visual system impairment in CADASIL. METHODS: A cohort of 34 genetically confirmed CADASIL patients was enrolled in an observational cross-sectional study. Subjects underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmological evaluation. Clinical features and common cardiovascular risk factors were also considered. Data were compared with those already reported in previous studies. RESULTS: Both afferent and efferent visual structures were commonly impaired in CADASIL patients. Retinal microvascular changes such as arteriolar narrowing and arteriovenous nicking, described in most patients and detected also in asymptomatic carriers, reflect the typical hemodynamic changes of CADASIL. However, less frequent findings, like early macular and lens changes, would indicate a possible further role played by susceptibility to premature aging and degeneration. Cotton wool spots and vessel occlusions were not common. Finally, eye movement abnormalities suggest that the brainstem is particularly vulnerable to damage in CADASIL.

PURPOSE: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare but potentially deadly tumor of the eye. Despite effective local therapies, recurrence and metastasis remain frequent. Once the tumor has metastasized, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor. To date, little is known of the genetic alterations in conjunctival melanomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted genetic analysis of 78 conjunctival melanomas, to our knowledge the largest cohort reported to date. An oncogene hotspot array was run on 38 samples, screening for a panel of known cancer-relevant mutations. Thirty tumors were analyzed for genome-wide copy number alterations (CNA) using array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Sanger sequencing of selected target mutations was conducted in all samples. RESULTS: BRAF mutations were identified in 23 of 78 (29%) tumors. NRAS mutations, previously not recognized as relevant in conjunctival melanoma, were detected in 14 of 78 (18%) tumors. We found CNAs affecting various chromosomes distributed across the genome in a pattern reminiscent of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma but differing markedly from uveal melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of NRAS or BRAF mutations in a mutually exclusive pattern in roughly half (47%) of conjunctival melanomas and the pattern of CNAs argue for conjunctival melanoma being closely related to cutaneous and mucosal melanoma but entirely distinct from uveal melanoma. Patients with metastatic conjunctival melanoma should be considered for therapeutic modalities available for metastatic cutaneous and mucosal melanoma including clinical trials of novel agents.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(BRAF,GOF,Conjunctivalmelanoma),(NRAS,GOF,Conjunctivalmelanoma)"}

Since dopamine deficiency has been found with cocaine addiction, our objective was to examine whether functional variants in the ankyrin repeat and kinase domain-containing 1 (ANKK1) and/or the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) genes interact with response to treatment with disulfiram. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cocaine and opioid codependent (DSM-IV) patients were stabilized on methadone and subsequently randomized into treatment groups - disulfiram (250 mg/day, N=31) or placebo (N=37). They were genotyped for ANKK1 (rs1800497) and DRD2 (rs2283265) polymorphisms, and the data were evaluated for an association between a cocaine-free state, as assessed by cocaine-free urine samples, and disulfiram treatment. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance corrected for population structure. RESULTS: Patients with CT or TT ANKK1 genotypes dropped from 80 to 52% cocaine-positive urines on disulfiram (N=13; P\ufffd\ufffd0.0001), whereas those on placebo (N=20) showed no treatment effect. Patients carrying the CC ANKK1 genotype showed no effect on treatment with disulfiram (N=18) or placebo (N=17). The GT/TT DRD2 genotype group showed a significant decrease in the number of cocaine-positive urine samples on disulfiram (N=9; 67-48%; P \ufffd\ufffd 0.0001), whereas the GG DRD2 genotype group showed only a marginal decrease (N=23; 84-63%; P=0.04). Genotype pattern analysis revealed that individuals carrying at least one minor allele in either gene responded better to disulfiram treatment (N=13; P \ufffd\ufffd 0.0001) compared with individuals carrying only the major alleles (N=17). CONCLUSION: A patient's genotype for ANKK1, DRD2, or both, may be used to identify individuals for whom disulfiram may be an effective pharmacotherapy for cocaine dependence.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(ANKK1,GOF,Cocaineabuse),(DRD2,GOF,Cocaineabuse)"}

BACKGROUND: The polymorphisms of serotonergic genes (5-HTTLPR and HTR1A rs6295) and separation life events have been studied to find an association with panic disorder, respectively. However, there are no studies that have yet evaluated the interaction effect between serotonergic genes and separation life events for panic disorder. METHODS: For this study, 194 panic disorder patients and 172 healthy controls were included for genotyping and environmental factor analysis. Separation life events were assessed using the Stressful Life Events Scale and clinical interviews. To evaluate the potential endophenotypes of panic disorder, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-revised (ASI-R), harm avoidance in the Temperament and Character Inventory (HA), and neuroticism in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (neuroticism) scales were administered. RESULTS: For 5-HTTLPR and HTR1A rs6295, there was no significant main effect of each genotype on panic disorder alone. However, the number of separation life events and their interaction with 5-HTTLPR showed a statistically significant effect on panic disorder. In addition, the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and the number of separation life events significantly affected the HA for potential endophenotypes.

Even if well-known and long-investigated, the application potential of RB1 mutation has not been fully tapped. In this review, we focus on the mechanism underlying RB1 mutation during oncogenesis.

Clinical, immunologic and radiographical examinations were performed, and 10 patients were empirically initiated on anticytokine therapy and monitored. Exome sequencing was used to identify a new pathogenic variant. Cytokine profiling, transcriptomics, immunoblotting and knock-in mice were used to assess the impact of ALPK1 mutations on protein function and immune signalling.\n Results: The majority of the cohort carried the p.Thr237Met mutation but we also identified a new ROSAH-associated mutation, p.Tyr254Cys.Nearly all patients exhibited at least one feature consistent with inflammation including recurrent fever, headaches with meningeal enhancement and premature basal ganglia/brainstem mineralisation on MRI, deforming arthritis and AA amyloidosis. However, there was significant phenotypic variation, even within families and some adults lacked functional visual deficits. While anti-TNF and anti-IL-1 therapies suppressed systemic inflammation and improved quality of life, anti-IL-6 (tocilizumab) was the only anticytokine therapy that improved intraocular inflammation (two of two patients).Patients' primary samples and in vitro assays with mutated ALPK1 constructs showed immune activation with increased NF-\ufffd\ufffdB signalling, STAT1 phosphorylation and interferon gene expression signature. Knock-in mice with the Alpk1 T237M mutation exhibited subclinical inflammation.Clinical features not conventionally attributed to inflammation were also common in the cohort and included short dental roots, enamel defects and decreased salivary flow. \n Conclusion: ROSAH syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease caused by gain-of-function mutations in ALPK1 and some features of disease are amenable to immunomodulatory therapy.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(ALPK1,GOF,ROSAHsyndrome)"}

In the final pre-specified analysis (64% maturity), median overall survival (OS) was 19.3 months for olaparib and 17.1 months for TPC (P = 0.513). Post-hoc extended follow-up, 25.7 months longer than previously reported for OS, is reported.\n Patients and methods: Patients with gBRCAm, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative mBC, who had received   2 lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease, were randomised 2:1 to olaparib (300 mg bid) or TPC. During extended follow-up, OS was analysed every 6 months using the stratified log-rank test (overall population) and Cox proportional hazards model (pre-specified subgroups). \n Results: In the overall population (302 patients; 76.8% maturity), median OS was 19.3 months for olaparib and 17.1 months for TPC (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.67-1.18); median follow-up was 18.9 and 15.5 months, respectively.

Mutations in some genes (WNT10A, WNT10B, AXIN2, ANTXR1, MSX1, EDA, EDAR, and EDARADD) can result in both syndromic and isolated TA. In addition, chromosomal anomalies are also responsible for syndromic TA (Down syndrome, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, Williams syndrome, and Pierre Robin sequence). The causes and manifestations of syndromic TA are highly complex, and this constitutes a clinical challenge.

VEXAS syndrome is characterized by a high mortality rate and significant clinical heterogeneity. We sought to determine independent predictors of survival in VEXAS and to understand the mechanistic basis for these factors. We analyzed 83 patients with somatic pathogenic variants in UBA1 at p.Met41 (p.Met41Leu/Thr/Val), the start codon for translation of the cytoplasmic isoform of UBA1 (UBA1b). Patients with the p.Met41Val genotype were most likely to have an undifferentiated inflammatory syndrome. Multivariate analysis showed ear chondritis was associated with increased survival, whereas transfusion dependence and the p.Met41Val variant were independently associated with decreased survival. Using in vitro models and patient-derived cells, we demonstrate that p.Met41Val variant supports less UBA1b translation than either p.Met41Leu or p.Met41Thr, providing a molecular rationale for decreased survival. In addition, we show that these 3 canonical VEXAS variants produce more UBA1b than any of the 6 other possible single-nucleotide variants within this codon. Finally, we report a patient, clinically diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome, with 2 novel mutations in UBA1 occurring in cis on the same allele. One mutation (c.121 A>T; p.Met41Leu) caused severely reduced translation of UBA1b in a reporter assay, but coexpression with the second mutation (c.119 G>C; p.Gly40Ala) rescued UBA1b levels to those of canonical mutations. We conclude that regulation of residual UBA1b translation is fundamental to the pathogenesis of VEXAS syndrome and contributes to disease prognosis.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(UBA1,LOF,VEXASsyndrome)"}
